# Diego's Portfolio (Google Software Product Sprint)

This is the source code of my portfolio; in this repository you’ll find two folders:
- Walkthroughs: This folder contains the tutorials to make the portfolio’s using [Google Cloud Shell](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor).
- Portfolio: This folder contains all the necessary files to make the frontend and backend website using Java as server-side language.
The website uses [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to function properly.
